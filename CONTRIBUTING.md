# Contributing

Thanks for helping improve Ultimate Dungeon!

## Quick Guidelines
- Keep Unity assets organized through the Unity Editor (avoid moving files in **Assets/** directly).
- Use feature branches: `feature/<short-description>`.
- Prefer small, focused pull requests with clear descriptions.

## Documentation
Documentation lives in **Docs/**. Update references if you move or rename documents.
